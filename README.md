# Odin Landing Page
This project is about creating a webpage and styling it using flex.

## How It's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS

For this project, I first started off by creating the HTML structure and other necessary content to mimick the provided design. Once all the necessary content is laid out, I then created a CSS file and focused on the header and footer, then the four main sections in between. Most of the styling involves the usage of flexbox in order to get texts, buttons, and images/placeholder images in the right place.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned there's a pattern when it comes to styling webpages, and this is reflected in my learning of the box model and other CSS tidbits from The Odin Project. In addition, practicing styling for this project has also helped me focused on putting what I learned into practice.

## Credits:

The numbered images I used for this project is from Interesting Is Hard's tutorial on Flexbox.
